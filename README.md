# 📍 Raycasting App — 3D Point Annotation Tool

An interactive 3D raycasting tool built with **React Three Fiber** and **three-mesh-bvh**. This app allows users to upload a 3D model, place 3D points by double-clicking on the surface, draw measurement lines, and display spatial annotations — ideal for spatial analysis, planning, or educational use.
